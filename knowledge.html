      <h1>What’s the definition of addiction?</h1>
      <p>An addiction is a chronic dysfunction of the brain system that involves reward, motivation, and memory. It’s about the way your body craves a substance or behavior, especially if it causes a compulsive or obsessive pursuit of “reward” and lack of concern over consequences. <br>Someone experiencing an addiction will:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>be unable stay away from the substance or stop the addictive behavior</li>
        <li>display a lack of self-control</li>
        <li>have an increased desire for the substance or behavior</li>
        <li>dismiss how their behavior may be causing problems</li>
        <li>lack an emotional response</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <h1>What are the signs?</h1>
      <p>Most signs of addiction relate to a person’s impaired ability to maintain self-control. This includes changes that are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>social, such as seeking out situations that encourage a substance or behavior</li>
        <li>behavioral, such increased secrecy</li>
        <li>health related, such as insomnia or memory loss</li>
        <li>increased levels of anxiety, depression, and sadness</li>
        <li>increased sensitivity and more severe reactions to stress</li>
        <li>trouble identifying feelings</li>
        <li>trouble telling the difference between feelings and the physical sensations of one’s emotions </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <h1>What causes addiction?</h1>
      <p>Addictive substances and behaviors can create a pleasurable “high” that’s physical and psychological. You’ll typically use more of certain substances or engage in behaviors longer to achieve the same high again. Over time, the addiction becomes difficult to stop.</p>
      <h2>The brain</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">Some people may try a substance or behavior and never approach it again, while others become addicted. This is partially due to the brain’s frontal lobes. The frontal lobe allows a person to delay feelings of reward or gratification. In addiction, the frontal lobe malfunctions and gratification is immediate.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">Additional areas of the brain may also play a role in addiction. The anterior cingulate cortex and the nucleus accumbens, which is associated with pleasurable sensations, can increase a person’s response when exposed to addictive substances and behaviors.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">Other possible causes of addiction include chemical imbalances in the brain and mental disorders such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. These disorders can lead to coping strategies that become addictions.</p>
      <h2>Early exposure</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">Experts believe that repeated and early exposure to addictive substances and behaviors play a significant role. Genetics also increase the likelihood of an addiction by about 50 percent,</p>
      <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">Environment and culture also play a role in how a person responds to a substance or behavior. A lack or disruption in a person’s social support system can lead to substance or behavioral addiction. Traumatic experiences that affect coping abilities can also lead to addictive behaviors.</p>
      <hr>
      <h1>What are the stages?</h1>
      <p>Addiction will often play out in stages. Your brain and body’s reactions at early stages of addiction are different from reactions during the later stages. <br> The four stages of addiction are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>experimentation: uses or engages out of curiosity</li>
        <li>social or regular: uses or engages in social situations or for social reasons</li>
        <li>problem or risk: uses or engages in an extreme way with disregard for consequences</li>
        <li>dependency: uses or engages in a behavior on a daily basis, or several times per day, despite possible negative consequences</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <h1>What are the complications?</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>physical, such as heart disease, HIV/AIDS, and neurological damage</li>
        <li>psychological and emotional, such as anxiety, stress, and depression</li>
        <li>Risk of heart attack, stroke and seizures</li>
        <li>Risk of damage to liver, lungs, liver and kidneys from long-term use</li>
        <li> Risk of impairment in memory, learning, problem solving and concentration; risk of psychosis — such as schizophrenia, hallucination or paranoia — later in life associated with early and frequent use</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>How to Overcome an Addiction</h1>
      <p>According to one model of behavior change known as the transtheoretical model, making any kind of change involves a process that starts with pre-contemplation and moves into contemplation.</p>
      <p>Once you make that decision to change, however, you can begin the process of preparing to take action.</p>
      <h2>Prepare to Change</h2>
      <p>Once you are clear on your goal, you may still need to prepare to change. Preparations include removing addictive substances from your home as well as eliminating triggers in your life that may make you more likely to use those substances again.</p>
      <p>This often means getting rid of items that might trigger your desire to use a substance or engage in a harmful behavior. You may also find it necessary to change your routine so that you have less contact with people or settings that trigger cravings.</p>
      <h2>Seek Social Support</h2>
      <p>Take time to contact friends and family who will support you in your goals. You might also want to let those friends who drink, use drugs, or engage in addictive behaviors know that you are planning to change.</p>

      <p> They may not understand—or you may be pleasantly surprised. Either way, it's a good idea to let them know of your goal and what they can do to support it (even if that means taking a break from the friendship for a time).</p>
      <h2>Get Treatment to Overcome an Addiction</h2>
      <p>There are many different treatments that can help you during the process of overcoming an addiction, including medical and psychological approaches. There is no one "right" type of addiction treatment, although some approaches are better supported by research than others. <br>Different types of therapy that may help include</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)</li>
        <li>Mindfulness therapy</li>
        <li>Motivational enhancement therapy (MET)</li>
        <li>Family therapy</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Manage Withdrawal Symptoms</h2>
      <p>Withdrawal symptoms can be a difficult aspect of overcoming addiction for both substance and behavioral addictions. With substance addictions, the physiological aspects of withdrawal can be extremely uncomfortable like a bad flu, or can even be life-threatening. For this reason, it is a good idea to talk to a doctor about the best way and the best place to quit a substance.</p>
      <p>In addition, addictions can sometimes mask underlying mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and even psychosis. If you are feeling blue or agitated, or you are concerned that the world or other people seem strange or upsetting since you quit, talk with a doctor. There are effective treatments that can help.</p>
      <h2>Avoid Relapse</h2>
      <p>While it can be disheartening and frustrating, relapse is quite common. Around 40% to 60% of people working to overcome a substance use disorder will relapse at some point.</p>
      <p>Common reasons for relapse include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cravings</li>
        <li>Thinking you can have "just one"</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Remember:</h2>
      <p>It is a different experience for everyone. Some people find it empowering. Others find it painful, difficult, and frustrating, sometimes needing many attempts before achieving their goal. Still, others discover new sides to themselves during the this process (a greater capacity for compassion, for example).
      There is no "right" way to feel while you are recovering. However, if you are feeling depressed or find yourself constantly wanting to return to the addictive behavior, you should seek support and treatment.</p>
