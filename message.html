                            So i am on my third attempt to stop using my drug of choice, Meth. My last attempt got me to a week shy of 6 years. That was my relapse less than a month ago.
                            I now think after i got over the initial grief that id relapsed again, that i am getting stronger and my freedom from using is getting longer. The moment i came into recovery i knew i wasn’t going to be one of those who got it straight away but here i am… Still trying now with almost 30 days up.

                            I feel the same Harsh. I’m going on 4yrs clean now after using for 39yrs. This is my one and only attempt of giving up and am pretty sure I won’t relapse as have been in situations where I’ve been faced with my drug of choice, meth, a few times but are completely disgusted by it and 100% don’t want to use. The problem is like you I don’t know where I belong or what to do with my life. I do suffer mental health issues too. I don’t feel smart enough to study as I started using drugs at age 13. I feel lost.
